### 1. Define the Purpose and Scope

- **Identify the problem** you are solving with the application.
	- The primary goal is to develop a web application designed to function as an external "brain." Its key purpose is to allow for efficient note-taking, storage in a cloud or vector database, and to integrate with Langchain and OpenAI's frameworks. This integration is intended to enable personalized queries about the user's notes and information, essentially allowing the user to have conversational interactions with their own stored knowledge.

- **Define your target audience.**
	- Initially, this application aims to serve as a personal tool for the creator, providing a more tailored and private alternative to using the OpenAI playground for managing and interrogating personal notes.

- **Outline the core functionalities** your app will include. This helps determine the scope of your project.
	- **Functional Requirements Outline:**
	    - **User Interface Development:** Design a user-friendly interface that facilitates easy note-taking, accessing, and management of information.
	    - **Database Integration:** Implement a cloud-based or vector database system for robust and scalable data storage.
	    - **Server Configuration:** Set up a server that will handle requests from the web application efficiently and securely.
	    - **Chat Functionality:** Develop a chat interface that allows users to interact with the Langchain and OpenAI frameworks seamlessly.
	    - **Agents and Memory Features:** Create intelligent agents that can process, remember, and retrieve information based on user interactions and queries, enhancing the personalized experience of the application.
